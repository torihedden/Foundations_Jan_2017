If I had to explain GitHub to a non-technical person, I would call it Google Docs for coders.

But you all are technical, so you get the real answer!

how many times have you been working on a project for anything and ended up with file names like:

FINAL_Version_2
FINAL_Version_2_EDITED
Version4
FinalDraft5
Final_no_really_this_time_EDITED


using version control can help with this sort of problem.
